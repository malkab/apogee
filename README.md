# APOGEE: Automatic POstgresql GEnErator

This is a personal project of doubtfull usefulness aimed at scripting psql scripts for the PostgreSQL / PostGIS in Python. It's an experiment.

## Structure

The main executable is called __apogee__. A single argument is needed: the file that holds the script definition. This script can import any other file needed, like a config file or any other library required.
